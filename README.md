# card-readings-app
Flask tarot and rune reader app

The tarot images are of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck from sacred-tarot and are in the public domain.

The rune images were created using the rune font.

## Usage

The only imported library is random.

The cards and runes are hard-coded.

`./oracle` will currently print a three-card and three-rune spread to stdout.
